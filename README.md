# lab-test-1
A climate research scientist has employed your services. She needs you to develop a program to help her discover trends in temperature data. She wants to know what the average temperature is over a period of 1 week. But she wants 2 different averages. One for the even numbered days (2, 4, 6) and one for the odd numbered days (1, 3, 5, 7). 


Write a Java program named TempAverages that reads in 7 temperatures (floating point format) and computes these 2 averages. Output the results as 2 double precision floating point numbers separated by a single space. She wants the even day average to appear first. 

Math review: the average of a group of numbers is found by adding up the numbers and then dividing the result of the addition by the number of numbers added.
